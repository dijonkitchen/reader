# Reader Readme

## What

A simple iOS app for reading RSS feeds

## Why

Test out a few things:

* [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app)
* [Expo](https://expo.io/)
* ES2015+ Test-Driven Development with:
    - [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)
    - [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/)
* [Yahoo Query Language](https://developer.yahoo.com/yql/)

## How

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
The most recent version of their guide for common tasks is available [here](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/react-native-scripts/template/README.md).

To use:
```sh
brew install node
brew install yarn
yarn install
yarn start
```

Then run Expo XDE or follow the instructions in the terminal!

To test:
```sh
yarn test
```

If you want to build the project "normally" with the [react-native-cli](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-simulator-ios.html),
you can switch to the [ejected](https://github.com/dijonkitchen/reader/tree/ejected) branch.

With that branch, testing is the same command, but running it on iOS
would be:
```sh
yarn install
react-native run-ios
```

You can use Xcode if you like too!

## When

A detailed roadmap of user stories is available in the [Projects](https://github.com/dijonkitchen/reader/projects/1?fullscreen=true).
